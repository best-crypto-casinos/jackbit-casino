The live casino at Jackbit powered by Evolution Gaming and Ezugi offers an authentic casino atmosphere. The HD streaming quality is excellent with minimal lag, which is crucial for games like blackjack and roulette.

My personal favorite is Mega Ball — it's essentially a supercharged bingo game with multipliers up to 100x. The presentation is spectacular, and the game show format keeps you engaged. I especially enjoy the dual Mega Ball rounds when they hit!

### Available Cryptocurrencies:
- Bitcoin (BTC)

The 1x deposit wagering requirement before withdrawal is actually quite reasonable compared to many other casinos, but it's important to be aware of it!

While Jackbit doesn't offer a dedicated app in app stores, their mobile-optimized website functions essentially like a native app. I've tested it extensively on both iOS and Android devices, and the experience is surprisingly smooth.

Pro tip: Add the site to your home screen for instant access — it works just like a regular app but saves you the hassle of downloading updates.
